<h1>hacking a magellan gps</h1>
<i>before using this as a tutorial make a backup of the device's storage this may or may not work on other model's</i>

I got this neat gps at a GoodWill and I figured out it run's <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Embedded_CE_6.0'>Windows CE 6.0</a>!,
 So i was curious and found this <a href='https://hackaday.com/tag/magellan-gps/'>hackaday</a> article
 when following it it turned out the way they loaded programs instead of the stock OEM software didn't work
 for me so instead what I did is connect the device with mini usb cable to my window's machine this most likly will work for unix and macos
 I made a backup of the drive that showed up on my pc incase anything went wrong then i went to the /apps folder and replaced the mgnShell.exe with MobileNavigator.exe 
 and then I had a working <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Embedded_CE_6.0'>Windows CE 6.0</a> box my device sadly has a broken battery so
 it needs external power at all time's but it still does work as a WinCE box!
